# Week 7

Sending out love with another week of fresh music. I’ve stumbled across a release by a completely unknown artist called Horizontal Phase, it’s definitely my favorite music of this week. Other stuff includes a debut solo release from Eris Drew, Rrose & Silent Servant combined forces on a diverse compilation and RX-101 brings you back into vintage-Rephlex sounds from 1995.<span style={{ display: 'block', marginBottom: "80px" }} />

# Horizontal Phase - Horizontal Phase

I couldn’t find anything about this artist called Horizontal Phase. The music on the same-named EP sounds absolutely amazing though. It covers aspects of genres like electro, ambient en jungle.
