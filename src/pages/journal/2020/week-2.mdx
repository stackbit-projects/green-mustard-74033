# Week 2

A lot of different styles in this week. It starts with half an hour ambient from the amazing Malibu. It’ll then take you on some 175 bpm breaks with a lot of acid, and will put you then back on earth with fresh sounds from Konduku.<div style={{ marginBottom: "80px" }} />

# TANK mix: Malibu

Back in December 2019 I saw Malibu perform a liveset in De School. It was one of the most intense experiences I’ve had with music ever. This 30 minute ambient set will let you feel something like that.

# Squarepusher – Nervelevers

Squarepusher is back! His new album ‘Be Up A Hello’ will be released on 31 January. After a five year break this is the Squarepusher how he used to be, fine vintage hardware sounds from the 90’s.

# Konduku - White Heron

During ADE I saw Konduku playing during Breakfast club. He plays one of the best odd-groove based techno. This album will show a glimp of that, sounds of snappy blips with mesmerising depth.
